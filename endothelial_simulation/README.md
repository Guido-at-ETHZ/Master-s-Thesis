# Endothelial Cell Simulation Framework

This repository contains a sophisticated, agent-based computational model for simulating the behavior of endothelial cell monolayers. The framework is designed to study cellular mechanotransduction, population dynamics, and spatial organization in response to various stimuli. It incorporates advanced features like event-driven simulation, model predictive control, and comprehensive analysis tools.

## Key Features

- **Agent-Based Modeling**: Each endothelial cell is an individual agent with its own state and properties.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: The simulation progresses based on discrete events, allowing for efficient and flexible modeling of complex biological processes.
- **Advanced Control Systems**: Includes a Model Predictive Control (MPC) module (`control/mpc_controller.py`) to simulate external interventions and control strategies.
- **Rich Biophysical Models**: Incorporates detailed models for population dynamics (proliferation, senescence), spatial properties (cell shape, orientation), and temporal dynamics.
- **Simulation Management**: Features robust configuration management and modules for specialized simulation scenarios like optimal stopping problems.
- **Comprehensive Visualization**: Extensive tools for generating plots, animations, and composite videos to analyze simulation results, including cell distributions and energy metrics.
