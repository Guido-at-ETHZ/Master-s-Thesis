| Vessel Type | Mean Shear Stress (Pa) | Peak Shear Stress (Pa) |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Aorta | 1.2-1.4 | 2.5-3.6 |
| Large Arteries | 0.5-2.0 | Up to 4.0 |
| Arterioles | 2.0-6.0 | - |
| Capillaries | 1.0-4.0 | - |
| Venules | 0.1-1.0 | - |
| Large Veins | 0.1-0.6 | - |
| Vena Cava | 0.1-0.2 | - |
| Disturbed Flow Regions | 0.02-0.2 | - |
| HUVECs (experimental) | 0.4-1.6 | - |

HUVECs (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells) are theoretically classified under the category of Large Veins. HUVECs are derived from the endothelium of the umbilical vein, which is considered a large vein.

## The influence of surface micro-structure on endothelialization under supraphysiological wall shear stress

At physiological WSS levels,
optimal endothelialization was obtained independently from surface topography. However, at higher
WSS levels, only monolayers grown on appropriately micro-structured surfaces preserved optimal
integrity. Under these ow conditions, endothelial cells polarized by the contact with the micro-structure
and, interestingly, oriented themselves in the direction perpendicular to ow.

Monolayer integrity is possible up until 6 Pa in gratings or 4 Pa in flat structures.

Maximum cell density is at 4 Pa in flat structures.
Pre-conditioning can be useful to have a higher Pressure as alighnemt could also be higher at 5 Pa.

## A free-form patterning method enabling endothelialization under dynamic flow

Endothelial Cell Response to Wall Shear Stress (WSS)

Under Normal Flow Conditions (WSS < 6 Pascals)
1. The endothelial cells gradually stretch out (elongate)
2. They align themselves parallel to the direction of blood flow
3. This alignment helps reduce resistance and allows for efficient blood flow

Under High Flow Conditions (WSS > 6 Pascals)
1. The cells change their orientation dramatically
2. Instead of aligning with the flow, they rotate to position themselves perpendicular (at a 90-degree angle) to the flow direction
3. This is likely a protective response to reduce the mechanical stress on the cells

Cell Polarity :Regardless of how the cells orient themselves physically, their internal polarity (the positioning of cellular components like the Golgi apparatus relative to the nucleus) continues to align with the flow direction. This suggests the cells maintain their ability to sense flow direction even when they change their physical orientation.


BF can increase cell density by a lot, and meaasures tend to be with lower variance

8 Pa for 12h and then 1.4 Pa can destroy the connectinvity of the monolayer

VE-cadherin phosphorylation were high in resting conditions (Fig. 6a) and were
not significantly increased by the exposure to flow (WSS of 1.4Pa). 
Steady levels of VE-cadherin phosphorylation correlated
with limited cell orientation


## Bistability of Dielectrically Anisotropic Nematic Crystals and the Adaptation of Endothelial Collectives to Stress Fields

Coherent cell polarity was established within 2–4 hours, while cell shape changes and collective alignment progressed more slowly, stabilizing after 6–8 hours. Under low wall shear stress (WSS, 1.4 Pa), cells elongated along the flow direction, whereas high WSS (8 Pa) induced faster remodeling, leading to perpendicular alignment. Despite these differences in orientation, both states maintained consistent planar cell polarity, with the Golgi positioned upstream of the nucleus, demonstrating robust organization under varying flow conditions

It's possible to measure the relative strain energy given by the system, so that you can measure the speed of response of it. In this way, it may be interesting to understand the behaviour. T = 8h/7h.
So the maximum is after 4h. 

Senescent endothelial cells fail to change shape in response to flow and generate monolayers where the cell aspect ratio
is unaﬀected, while the cell orientation remains randomly distributed despite the exposure to WSS

The model prediction was experimentally verified exposing endothelial monolayers, featuring precisely controlled ratios of young and senescent cells, to flow generating a WSS of 1.4 Pa. The average cell orientation along the direction of
flow was gradually lost in monolayers featuring 0, 30, 70, and 100% of senescent endothelial cells (≈21°,31°,37°,and47°,respectively).

Senescence reduces angle of change on a linear model.
